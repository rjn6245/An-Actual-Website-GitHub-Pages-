This is my website that I made for this assignment called "An Actual Website". It is for the class called AP Computer Science Principles.

So far, I am enjoying AP CompSciPrncples as it is easy and a slower paced course compared to my other classes which I enjoy. The two classes I enjoy the most so far are Cross Country and this class as they are fun and not too hard for me, so they are very enjoyable. I am also learning a lot of stuff this year, which is nice, but the pace is a bit too fast for me at the moment.
